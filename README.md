## Example
```js
const layout = new Layout(table);
layout.style = {
	body: { height : 100 },
	txt2: {
		text: ["title", "subtitle"],
		color: [new Color("#hex"), new Color("#hex")]
	}
}
layout.style.btn1 = {
	title: "click!",
	id: "ButtonAction"
}
layout.event = {
	ButtonAction: () => {}
}
layout.ApplyStyles();
```
In this example, btn1 is placed to the left of txt2 based on the key number, even though txt2 defined before btn1 defined.
